“@PerezHilton: Halle Berry is easily one of the WORST dressed at the #GoldenGlobes! http://t.co/CviGJ8cr” Thats bc that dress was disgusting  

Least favorite dress was Kristen Bell. My boys said that Lucy Liu's flowered dress will win worst dressed award. #GoldenGlobes  

Oh god! Eva Longoria's dress is awful. #GoldenGlobes
