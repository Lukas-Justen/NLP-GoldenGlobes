# How to get the data

1. Go to this [Canvas](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/88875/files/folder/Project%201?) page
2. Download the gg2013.json.zip and gg2015.json.zip
3. Put both files into this folder and unpack them
4. Make sure that there is only a gg2013.json and a gg2015.json file

These two files are part of the .gitignore and won't be pushed to the repo. Therefore, everyone of us has to download these files by themselves.
