# How to get the data

1. Go to this [Canvas](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/88875/files/folder/Project%201?) page
2. Download the gg2013.json.zip and gg2015.json.zip
3. Put both files into this folder

These two files are part of the .gitignore and won't be pushed to the repo. Therefore, everyone of us has to download these files by themselves.
